# Food-Delivery-Application


Application similar to Uber Eats that allow customer, drivers and restaurants to communicate such that customers can order food from restaurants while drivers will pickup and drop off at the specified location. This full stack web-based solution uses React, TailwindCSS and MUI on the frontend, with Node, Express and Apollo Server on the middleware. The connection between the frontend and middleware is through Graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions. The data-layer connects the middleware with the persisted information stored in the database through REST api calls.
